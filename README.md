# Hardware-Implementation-of-4x4-systolic-array-architecture
I implemented a 4×4 systolic array in hardware for matrix multiplication. Using parallel multiply–accumulate operations across processing elements, the full 4×4 result is obtained in just seven clock cycles. This efficient design highlights the speed and scalability of systolic architectures.
